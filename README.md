The website is built using the following technologies:

HTML: Used for structuring the web page and defining the content.
CSS: Used for styling the web page and making it visually appealing.
JavaScript: Used for retrieving data from the News API, manipulating the DOM, and implementing the search and filtering functionalities.
News API: An API that provides access to a wide range of news articles from various sources.
Getting Started
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository or download the source code as a ZIP file.

Open the project directory in your preferred code editor.

Obtain an API key from the News API website. Sign up for an account if you don't have one already.

In the project files, locate the JavaScript file responsible for fetching data from the API (e.g., script.js).

Replace the placeholder value for the API key with your actual API key. It should look something like this:

javascript
Copy code
const apiKey = 'YOUR_API_KEY';
Save the file.

Open the HTML file (e.g., index.html) in a web browser, and you should see the news website up and running.

Customization
You can customize the website according to your needs:

Styling: Modify the CSS styles in the styles.css file to change the colors, fonts, layout, or any other visual aspects of the website.

Layout: Modify the HTML structure in the index.html file to change the layout of the web page. You can add or remove sections, rearrange elements, or introduce new components as desired.

API Integration: The website is currently configured to use the News API. If you want to switch to a different news API or use a different data source, you will need to modify the JavaScript code responsible for fetching and processing the data accordingly.
